This project builds a leaflet map of live Earthquake data that is pulled from the United States Geological Survey. The circular markers are color coded from light blue to purple to signify the depth of the earthquake in kilometers, and the size of the circle scales with earthquake magnitude.

This project involves the following steps:
Retrieving geojson data from USGS API
Generating markers on the map using the geojson data
Formatting the page and creating a legend using HTML and stylizing with CSS
